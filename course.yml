short_name: Solana Voting
release_status: beta
description: |-
  Build a decentralized voting application on the Solana blockchain. In this challenge,
  you'll create a secure, on-chain voting program using Anchor framework that allows
  users to create polls, cast votes, and view results in a trustless manner.

  Along the way, you'll learn about Solana's account model, program-derived addresses (PDAs),
  cross-program invocations, and on-chain state management. You'll also master Rust for
  Solana development and understand how to build secure, gas-efficient smart contracts.

  By the end, you'll have a fully functional voting dApp that demonstrates core
  Web3 concepts and Solana development best practices.
summary: Build a decentralized voting application on Solana blockchain using Anchor framework
