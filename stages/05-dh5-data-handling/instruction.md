Now that you have the account structure and context defined, it's time to
implement the function that actually initializes the proposal data. This stage
focuses on safe data handling and proper initialization patterns.

## Prerequisite Reading

To understand data handling in Anchor, review:

- **Anchor Context Usage**: Learn how to access and modify account data within
  instruction functions. The [Anchor Context
  Documentation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/basics/program-structure#instruction-context)
  explains how to work with account references.
- **Rust Borrowing and Mutability**: Understand Rust's ownership system,
  particularly mutable references (`&mut`). Review [Rust Ownership
  Chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html) for
  fundamental concepts.
- **Data Validation Patterns**: Learn about common validation patterns in smart
  contract development. The [Anchor Error Handling
  Documentation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/errors) shows how to validate
  inputs safely.

## Implement the initialize_proposal Function

Add the following function to your program:

```rust
pub fn initialize_proposal(
    ctx: Context<InitializeProposal>,
    title: String,
    options: Vec<String>
) -> Result<()> {
    let proposal = &mut ctx.accounts.proposal;
    proposal.title = title;
    proposal.options = options.clone();
    proposal.votes = vec![0; options.len()];
    proposal.bump = *ctx.bumps.get("proposal").unwrap();
    Ok(())
}
```

## Understanding the Implementation

Let's examine each line and its purpose:

- **`let proposal = &mut ctx.accounts.proposal;`**: Creates a mutable reference
  to the proposal account. The `&mut` is crucial for modifying the account data.

- **`proposal.title = title;`**: Assigns the provided title to the account.
  Strings in Rust implement move semantics, so this transfers ownership.

- **`proposal.options = options.clone();`**: Clones the options vector instead
  of moving it. This is necessary because we need the original `options` for the
  next line.

- **`proposal.votes = vec![0; options.len()];`**: Initializes the votes vector
  with zeros, with length matching the number of options. This ensures each
  option starts with zero votes.

- **`proposal.bump = *ctx.bumps.get("proposal").unwrap();`**: Retrieves and
  stores the bump seed from the context. This is important for future
  interactions with the PDA.

- **`Ok(())`**: Returns a successful result, indicating the operation completed
  without errors.

## Why Clone is Used

The `options.clone()` is necessary because:
- We need to use the `options` value twice (for storing options and determining
  votes length)
- Rust's ownership system prevents using a value after it's moved
- Cloning creates a copy, allowing both operations to proceed

## Test Cases

| Test | Expected Result | Purpose |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Function compiles | No syntax errors | Ensures proper Rust syntax |
| Data assignment | Title and options stored correctly | Validates data storage functionality |
| Votes initialization | All options start with 0 votes | Confirms proper vote tracking setup |
| Bump storage | PDA bump seed properly stored | Ensures security feature implementation |

## Notes

- Always use `&mut` when you need to modify account data
- Be mindful of Rust's ownership rules when working with complex data types
- Clone data when you need to use it multiple times in different contexts
- Store the bump seed for future PDA operations and security
